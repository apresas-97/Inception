Things to-do before eval:

[] Set up VM so you don't get those --chmod errors
[] Change user in the VM so it's your proper login
[] Change user and home variables in Makefile to your proper login
[] Rememebr to save .env locally and not push it to the submit repo, add .env to its .gitignore to be cure
[] Test that everything works
[] Set up DNS thingy /etc/hosts so you can use the domain as url
[] Something else?
[] Double check, but don't go too overboard or you won't have time to eval
[] do that whole thing about setting up the ssh key for 42's repos in the VM etc
[] submit
